<p>Krishnamurti talks about the factors of thought and how it inherently distorts our perceptions of reality,
        because reality is not thought, and any reality perceived and analyzed by thought is automatically distorted
        since this thought is based on our own flawed and conditioned views of the universe and ourselves.
