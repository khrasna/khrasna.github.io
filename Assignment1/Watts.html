    <p>Alan Watts was a theologian who brought eastern philosophies to the western world.
        He talked about how people go about their daily lives, and how Zen buddhism and
        eastern philosophies can change our perception of the world, which also changes our lives. 
        Watts also talks about the Ego, which he shows us to be an illusory idea which doesn't actually exist,
        but it is also something completely necessary. He discusses the union of illusory ego and the physical body,
        and explains how they are one.
